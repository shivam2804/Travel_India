                <p class="indiadesc">                
                Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian
                subcontinent. Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these
                cuisines vary substantially and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits. Indian
                food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hinduism, cultural choices and
                traditions. Centuries of Islamic rule, particularly by the Mughals, also introduced dishes like
                samosa and pilaf.Historical events such as invasions, trade relations, and colonialism have played a
                role in introducing certain foods to this country. The Columbian discovery of the New World brought
                a number of new vegetables and fruit to India. A number of these such as the potato, tomatoes, chillies,
                peanuts, and Guava have become staples in many regions of India.Indian cuisine has shaped the
                history of international relations; the spice trade between India and Europe was the primary
                catalyst for Europe's Age of Discovery.Spices were bought from India and traded around Europe
                and Asia. Indian cuisine has influenced other cuisines across the world, especially those from
                Europe (especially Britain), the Middle East, Southern African, East Africa, Southeast Asia, North
                America, Mauritius, Fiji, Oceania, and the Caribbean.Indian cuisine reflects an 8,000-year history
                of various groups and cultures interacting with the Indian subcontinent, leading to diversity of
                flavours and regional cuisines found in modern-day India. Later, trade with British and Portuguese
                influence added to the already diverse Indian cuisine.
